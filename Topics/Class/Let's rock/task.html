<h2>Let's rock</h2>
<p>There are many bands in the world that perform all kinds of music. Let's suppose for a second that you're a fan of rock and want to create a program that deals with rock bands.</p>

<p>For that, you obviously need the class <code class="java">RockBand</code> with such attributes as <code class="java">genre</code> ("rock") and <code class="java">key_instruments</code> (by default, a list <code class="java">["electric guitar", "drums"]</code>). Let's also, for the sake of simplicity, assume <code class="java">n_members</code> to be a class attribute equal to 4, since most rock bands do have 4 members.</p>

<p>Create this class and an object of that class: name the variable after any rock band that you like. Print the attributes of your rock band on separate lines in this order: <strong>genre, </strong><strong>n_members, key_instruments.</strong></p>

<p>Make sure that the attributes have correct types: <code class="java">genre</code> is a string, <code class="java">n_members</code> is an integer, and <code class="java">key_instruments</code> is a list.</p><br><br><font color="gray">内存限制: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">时间限制: 15 秒</font><br><br>
